## About Walk it

The number of obese people in the United States has more than tripled from 1970 to 2010 (according to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su6203a20.htm"> this study</a>) and the prediction looks far worse (<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1909301">50% of the United States population will be obese until 2030</a>). So the solution proposed by me to this problem is: "Walk it".

The studies have shown that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4842440/"> walking </a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3632337/">sleeping enough hours/night</a> greatly reduce the obesity risk.
So, I have built a mobile application that helps you to track your steps, weight progress, sleep duration (using Machine Learning techniques) and calculate your pulse.
